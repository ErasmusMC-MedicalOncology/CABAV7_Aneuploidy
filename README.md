# Custom scripts - Analysis of the prognostic potential of (dichotomized) aneuploidy scores in mCRPC.

This repository contains the custom code (R) used to perform all analysis of the study as further detailed by Isebia et al. in <JOURNAL> (2022): [LINE-1 element sequencing-derived aneuploidy score from circulating cell-free DNA is a prognostic biomarker in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer](https://www.google.com/).

All processed (and cleaned) data as-used in the presented analysis and figures has been published alongside the manuscript (Suppl. Table 1 and Suppl. Table 2).

All provided code in the R/ folder was performed on Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS with the following *R* version:
```R
R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23) -- "Funny-Looking Kid"
Copyright (C) 2022 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)

Required R dependencies are listed on the top of each script.
